## Projects

1. **Courses Management Module**  
   - Used computed fields and onchange decorators  
   - Custom views (tree, form, kanban)  
   - Security rules & access control implemented  
   [View on GitHub](link)


## My Approach

- I always start by planning models and relations before coding.
- I implement business logic with proper validation and security rules.
- All views and actions are user-friendly and integrated with Odoo's workflow.
- I test modules on a real Odoo server and use Git for version control.
